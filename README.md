# `A useless entertainment plugin for DanhengServer`

Based on [DanhengPlugin-BasePlugin]([EggLinks/DanhengPlugin-BasePlugin](https://github.com/EggLinks/DanhengPlugin-BasePlugin))

## How to use?

Build it, and then put the DanhengPlugin-Lol.dll file into your {Server}/Plugins folder, and then restart the server, ok.

## What it can do？

Use  `/lol fly` can help your character soar into the sky

Use `/lol move x y z` allows your character to ignore terrain and buildings to pass through walls or fly and burrow. Here, x, y, and z represent coordinates, which can be negative to indicate the opposite direction, for example, `/lol move 1000 -5000 3000`. All movements are based on the character's current coordinates.

Use `/lol team id id id id` to set up your current team. This is a rather useless feature (what can I say👀️ ). However, you can set four identical characters in the team, but it's best not to do this, as it will cause bugs such as your inability to enter battles.
